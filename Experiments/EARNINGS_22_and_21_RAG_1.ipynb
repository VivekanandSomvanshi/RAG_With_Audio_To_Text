At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host Michael Frenz. Sir, the floor is yours. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for the third quarter 2020 Clipper Realty Inc earnings conference call. Participating with me on today's call are David Bistricer, co-chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer, and JJ Bistricer, Chief Operating Officer.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to our co-chairman and CEO, David Bistricer. Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter of 2020 earnings call for Clipper Realty. I will provide an update on our business performance including recent highlights and milestones as well as how our company is responding to COVID-19 pandemic. I will then turn the call over to J.J. who will discuss property level activities, including leasing performance and measures taken in line of the pandemic. Finally, Michael will speak about our quarterly financial performance. We will then take your questions. I will begin by thanking the entire Clipper team for the continued hard work and perseverance during this challenging period. The ongoing dedication to our residents, our communities, and our business has been remarkable throughout the course of the pande- the pandemic and we are grateful for their efforts. Our properties have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic. We continue to take necessary steps to keep our tenants safe in compliance with state and local orders and providing typical services to our residents. During the third quarter, we witnessed some pressure on occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties driven by economic activity declines related to COVID-19. At quarter end, the residential properties was 93% leased compared to 96% at the end of the second quarter. Despite the current headwinds we are confident in the resiliency of New York city and we expect that properties in the New York city market to remain desirable to a broad range of tenants and our operations to return to a normal rate state over time. Our balance sheet continues to be, to be well positioned from a liquidity perspective to manage through it, through the pandemic. We have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million unrestricted cash and $22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on asset by asset basis and debt in recourse, in non-recourse and in non-cross-collateralized. We have no debt maturity on any of our operating properties until 2027. During the third quarter, we purchased 45,858 shares of common stock, at a weighted average price of $5.90 cents a share on the $10 million stock repurchase program announced in August. At the end of the quarter we had $9.7 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. Turning to upcoming developments, we continue to proceed with the redevelopment of our 10, 10 Pacific street acquisition located in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, about one mile from the, one mile from the Atlantic Terminal Barclays Ha- Center Hall. As previously disclosed, we estimated the project will cost approximately $85 million in total and take two years to complete and develop a 6.5% stabilized cap rate. J.J. will provide further update on the project shortly. In our off- office portfolio, the new lease <inaudible> with the city of New York, 250 Livingstone street commenced in August, this lease is expected to initially add substantially approximately five point million dollars to the property's annual NOL and is significant as a significant milestone for the company. At 141 Livingston street, the city's rent will increase 25% at the end of December, which will add $2.1 million to the property's annual NOI. Together these roles are expected to add an incremental $7.1 million of annual NOI to our portfolio representing approximately 10% increase on a normalized run rate. At our Flatbush Gardens property we are continuing with the uniform land use review procedure or ULURP-approved process with the city, we anticipate that approval will add significant floor area ratio for the complex, meaningfully expanding the size of the property, adding significant value and allowing us to begin development. There is no assurance however that the application will fully or partially approve once submitted. I'd like to provide an update to the Tribeca House 421-g Kuzmich litigation. As previously discussed the New York City Court of Appeals ruled in June, 2019, that the apartments the buildings receiving 421 G tax benefits are not subject to luxury deregulation. October 29th, the appellate divisi- division applied, app-app-applied the court of appeals ruling the Gina case only that the base rent of determination rent over charges is four years prior to the 2016 filing of the Kuzmich complaint and overcharges, if any, are to be determined by comparing the rents actually charged during the four-year period to the rent increases committed by New York City rent- rent guidelines board. Although none of eliminating overcharged liability altogether, this ruling is expected to limit our financial exposure in this regard. The appellate division however, from the law courts award of attorney's fees to the plaintiff's tenants. The case will likely be remanded back to the lower court, which would determine the amounts of liability for rent overcharge and attorney's fees, no future court dates have been scheduled as of yet. We do not believe that this litigation will have a material impact on our business, as it, as it pertains to the limited subsets of previous and existing tenants at the property. The vast majority of current tenants and all future movements are not impacted by litigation as those units are free market. Lastly, I would like to comment on a third quarter results, results. We are reporting quarterly revenues of $29.6 million, NOI of $14.5 million in AFFO of $2.9 million, results that reflect the current headwinds discussed earlier. Michael will provide further details on our financial performance shortly. I will now turn the call over to JJ who provided an update and operations and our response to the pandemic, including a target overhead reduction to future streamline expenses. Thank you. I begin by asking, by again thanking our colleagues at our properties and corporate office for their tireless efforts throughout this challenging period. Their unwavering commitment to our attendance to communities has been inspiring. We faced certain revenue challenges in the third quarter as a result of declines and economic activity related to COVID-19. Third quarter total revenue was 3.6% lower than second quarter total revenue driven by declines in occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties due to the ongoing pandemic. Rent per square foot at Tribeca was $66 at the end of the third quarter, we are working diligently to manage revenue at the property and note that occupancy has recently increased 83%. Long, longer term we believe that occupancy and rental rates at the property we'll return to pre COVID levels given Tribecca houses attractiveness from a pricing standpoint, compared to other luxury buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. The Flatbush Gardens Complex and Brooklyn held up well in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint. As it is throughout the pandemic, the property maintain high occupancy ending the quarter over 96% leased. Rent per square foot was a record $25 and 10 cents at the end of the quarter. We continue to proactively streamlined the business and manage our expense base and have recog, reorganized certain operations at the property, which is expected to result in annual cost savings in excess of $800,000. Flatbush Gardens is a key element of our portfolio and growth story with the FAR expansion project and incremental value opportunity. The Clover House Aspen in 10 West 65th street properties experienced some <inaudible> and pricing pressures due to COVID-19, each ending the third quarter approximately 90% least compared to middle 90 levels at the end of the second quarter. We have however seen a recent uptick in activity at these properties with occupancy gains ranging from 380 to 610 basis points since the end of the quarter. Collections have remained strong during the pandemic, our rent collection rate is in the third quarter was 97%. We continue to work with tenants on a case-by-case basis when they notify us that they cannot meet their rent obligations as a result of the pandemic, including reviewing potential alternative payment arrangements. On the development side, we are completing the necessary regulatory process at 1010 Pacific street to construct a nine storey, 119,000 rentable square foot, fully amenitized, multi-family rental building with underground indoor parking. The property will have 175 total units, 70% of which will be free market and 30% affordable and is eligible for a 35 year 421-a tax abatement. We are in the process of negotiation, negotiating a construction loan for the project. Looking ahead, we are focused on optimizing occupancy, pricing and expense across, expenses across the business against the backdrop of ongoing pandemic driven headwinds that continue to pressure both our portfolio and the New York city market in general. The near term environment will remain challenging but we are committed to strongly positioning ourselves to emerge from the pandemic. I will now turn over the call of Michael who will discuss our financial results. Just one moment, gentlemen, Michael's line has disconnected. We're reconnecting him now. Hello? Yes. This is the operator we're trying to connect Michael Frenz, his line has dropped Yes. That's me. I'm back. Oh, you're back. Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Micheal your on. Oh yeah, thanks guys, apologies for that I had a connection problem. Okay. For the third quarter, we achieved revenues of $29.6 million an increase of 0.2 million or 0.6% compared to the same period in 2019. We achieved NOI of 14.5 million and AFFO of $2.9 million or six cents per share. The year over year total revenue increase was primarily attributable to the commencement of the new office lease at the 250 Livingstone Street property and bringing the global house property online during the third quarter of 2019. Partially offset by decline in leased occupancy and residential rental rate to Tribeca house property. On the expense side, to year over year changes were as follows. Property, property operating expenses increased by 0.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily driven by an increase in the provision for bad debt due to the impact of COVID-19. Real estate taxes and insurance increased by $0.7 million in the third quarter due to property tax increases across the portfolio and general insurance industry cost increases. Interest expense increased by 1.5 million in the third quarter year on year, primarily due to the recognition of interest expense in connection with bringing Clover House online and the refinancing of the Flatbush Garden's Property in May. As David mentioned earlier, we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective. As of September 30th, we have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and 22 million of restricted cash. We finance our portfolio on an asset by asset basis. Our debt is non-recourse and its not cross-collateralized. We have no debt maturities on any operating properties until 2027. Lastly, today we are announcing a dividend of nine and a half cents per share for the third quarter, the same amount as last quarter, the dividend will be paid on November 27th to shareholders of record on November 20th. Let me now turn the call back over to David for concluding remarks. Thank you, Michael. We have remained focused on efficiently operating a portfolio throughout the pandemic with the safety about tenants and employees our highest priority. We continue to take the necessary steps, steps to navigate through the current challenges leveraged by strong balance sheet. New York City has survived and thrive through challenging circumstances over time and we have every confidence as a city will emerge from the pandemic as strong as ever. We actively look forward to capitalizing in a myriad of growth opportunities including the 1010 Pacific Street redevelopments, and the potential expansion of Flatbush Gardens. We hope everyone stays safe and healthy with that. I'd like to open up the line for questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, the floor is open for questions. If you have any questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one on your touch tone phone, pressing star two will remove you from the queue should your question be answered. And lastly, while posing your question, please pick up your handset, if listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality, please hold while we pull for questions. And your first question is coming from a Craig Kusera. Craig, your lines live. Yeah. Hi. Um, I just wanted to confirm. Guys, did you say that, um, outside of Tribeca where you gave the update that, that occupancy had improved to 83%, uh, you mentioned Flatbush that, that all the other properties had seen anywhere from 380 to 610 basis point occupancy, uh, since the third quarter? Yes. Yeah, hi Craig, how are you? When, at the end of the second quarter some of the properties, as we said, Aspen, 10 West and Clover house, they were all in the mid nineties percent occupancy range, 95 to 97%. By the end of the third quarter, they had dipped a bit to 90%, but since the end of the third quarter, between end of September and today, we see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from three to four to five percent. So, the Aspen, 10 West and Clover House has properties currently are least ranging from 92 to 95%. Okay, great. And, um, I just wanted to follow up on, um\\u2026 And h-h-h-have rents trended basically flattened in here in the, in the, in the fourth quarter? Or has, has there been any rent concessions to get those folks back? J.J do you want to talk through that? Sure. Um, so the rents have pretty much stayed, um, a drop below what they were prior simply because we're trying to recapture occupancy so that we're well, well, you know, positioned for when the market does come back to stop pushing rents again. So for now we're doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartments. So there's a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that. Got it. And, uh, and just one more for me. Um, you know, are you tracking or able to track whether, um, you know, as the folks moved out from second to third quarter, are they, are they staying in market or are these people that are basically just exiting the markets? Uh, maybe they'll come back at some point in the future, but are no longer in the greater New York MSA. Um, to answer that again, without the exact detail numbers, um, the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of, out of the cities. Some of them depending on the property they are moving to, let's say second homes that they have in the suburbs. Um, many of them tell us when on the way out they say, You know, we wish this didn't come to this, we, we hope to be back soon. We really liked the, the property and we're looking forward to when things get back to normal so we can return to the city. Okay. Well, that's, that's encouraging. Uh, that's it for me. Thanks guys. If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one. Okay, next question is coming from Buck Horne. Buck, you lines live. Yeah. Hey, thanks. Hey Mike, could you just quantify what, what the bad debt expense was in the quarter? I don't know if you ever. Did you break that up? The operating expenses? Absolutely. Uh, as a refresher in the second quarter, as you, as you know, we took about a $600,000 bad debt expense. And now into the third quarter here, again, given the high collections rate, collection rate, as J.J said, we're still in this sort of in the high nineties. Uh, so what we've seen is actually to date pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers. Uh, all in all, in the third quarter, we took approximate $660,000 charge for bad debt, so about a 10% increase over the second quarter, but again given everything that's been going on, uh, with the pandemic, I think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see, uh, collections hold up overall. Okay. If there any remaining questions or comments please indicate So now by pressing star one. Okay we have no remaining questions in queue. Thank you for us today. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Stay safe. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation. Thank You.\",\n          \"Good morning. This is Craig Moore with Autonomous. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fifth annual Future of Commerce Symposium. Sorry for the brief delay in getting started. I just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started. Um, you can use the same dialing or web link for the entire day. There'll be a few breaks, but for many of the sessions, we will just move right into the next, uh, the next discussion. You can submit questions, uh, to us via, uh, email to myself or <unk>. Uh, you can also use Bloomberg IV to find us with questions or you can use the q&a box within, uh your Zoom window. Um, so with, with no further ado, let's get started. Um, we're lucky to have with us this morning, American Express Doug Buckminster group head Global Consumer Services. It's great to see you again, Doug. I wish it was in person. I wish it was in Carnegie Hall, but maybe next year. How are you? Exactly. It's great, great to see you too Craig. Thanks, for having me. Yeah, you bet. Um, so, um, love the background, love the image, um, but- <laugh>. let me, uh\\u2026 while we get started with just, you know, a, a, um, a broad question, which is, you know, can you update us on the state of consumer and overall spending at this point in the recovery? Yeah. You know, I, I think, um, as we've talked about before, we saw the trough in April, and we've seen a rebound since then. You know, I would characterize, uh, the trend since mid July as relatively stable on the non TNT side. So outside of TNT relatively stable, little bouncing around due to days mix timing of holidays, like Labor Day in particular. And slow, very steady growth, but, but slow growth on the TNT side. Right? So I, I would say stable would be the, the adjective that captures that dust. Okay. Um, at this point, I assume\\u2026 could we perhaps characterize this a little, go a little deeper on this ex TNT, um, if you were to characterize the overall volumes, you're seeing ex TNT ex corporate card, you know, really are consumers getting back toward positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point? Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, consumers consume, right? They're gonna figure out a way, uh, to live their life and, um, and enrich their lives. And I would say, while there's a lot of substitution in the non candy space, especially physical for, for online and e-com, I would say, we feel good, that healthy levels of consumer volumes there, um, I think what's gonna, what's gonna define the trajectory of, uh, volume rebound from here on out is, uh, is the direction of TNT, which, which you know, is a category, uh, we over index on. So maybe some thoughts there. You know, Amex has a deeper understanding of TNT than I think any other card issuer, especially considering the network and the insights you get off of that, um, on a global basis. So maybe, uh, your thoughts on how we recover from this. Are there any green shoots you're seeing in TNT at all, at this point? I mean, I think, um, you know, my position is consumer travel will come back. Um, I think that's our, our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back. It's an essential part of, uh, the consumer experience, especially in our demographic. Um, I think, you know, what we've seen to date in terms of the rebound is an effect of substitution. So people substituting driving vacations, homestay rentals for you know, uh, for air based travel. And in some categories, we've seen innovation as well, right? I've seen the dining space in particular expansion of outdoor dining, pick up, take away delivery, at home meal prep, uh, that level of innovation has, uh, has bounced, uh, the restaurant category, more than you would expect, just from dying in volumes alone. Right? Um, so I think, you know, where, when we get back to historic levels, I think is, is largely a question of, of confidence and medical solutions, right. I think, I, I think, uh, the establishment of the vaccine, the approval of the vaccine, I expect, will unleash a lot of anticipatory and pent up demand on consumers. They will start travel planning again, the interest in travel based payment products, and travel based loyalty currencies, I think will, will spike is all that pent up demand for travel, people start to see the end in sight, though they start to build confidence that in a six to 12 month time period. Uh, they'll be able to travel again. But I think getting back to historic, uh, volumes is gonna require that. mm-hmm <affirmative>. And in terms of how that affects the discount rate at American Express, um, especially without the long haul cro\\u2026 the, the long haul travel, um, maybe a, a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out. Yeah. Well, there's no, there's no question that, um, the TNT volumes, taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate. Right? So I think, um, you know, the discount rate we, we've been on record for a few years now saying we, we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on driving discount revenue and utility through programs like dark blue, certain b2b categories, um, but there's no question, you know, that historic discount rate has taken a mix related impact as a result of really a disproportionate fall in, uh, in TNT, TNT spend. Okay. We'll, we'll, we'll move off of that, that topic that isn't, uh, helpful right now in terms of the dynamic, but maybe on to something that is, which is, you know, can you discuss how spending habits have changed? You know, and to what degree you're seeing these habits, you know, coalesce into long term, uh, repeatable behavior, you know, especially around e-com contactless- Yeah. and if it's different between consumer segments. Yeah. You know, I think, um, my take on the effects of this crisis are that it didn't create any new trends, but it changed sort of the slope of pre existing trends, right? e-commerce was taking share from offline. Digital payments were taking share from cash at POS, right? And we have seen a, an inflection or kink in those curves, uh, as most issuers have over the last, uh, six months, you know, whether we've seen those trends accelerated by year, two years, it's anybody's guess. But I don't think, I don't think we're going backwards from those trends as the crisis, uh, as the crisis relaxes. Um, you know, I think on the contactless side, you know, there's a lot of noise around that. There are markets outside the US, as you know, Southeast Asia, Australia, the UK, where there's very deep, uh, contactless penetration and, um, and that has continued to gain share during this crisis. In the US, the contactless volumes are much more modest. They are increasing at a rapid rate. But I do expect that the move away from cash, and the comfort with using credit products, even for micro level transactions at POS, uh, will be an enduring outcome of this. And I, I think, um, while I don't think it does a lot per se, to drive dollar volumes of billings, I think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of, of credit products. And in some markets outside the US where e-com is less established, it's had a more profound effect like Italy is a face-to-face retail market. We've seen phenomenal growth in e-commerce. What's interesting is, well over 50% of the participants in e-commerce in any month during the first few months of the crisis, had never had an e-commerce transaction on Amex before. Wow. Um, so there we've seen some real, um\\u2026 I, I, I again, I think it's a trend that would have played out, but it was a very large acceleration of that trend. And correct me if I'm wrong, but Amex has a, a better acceptance footprint outside the US in e-ecom than it does in brick and mortar. I\\u2026 yeah. I would say that's probably true, uh, by large due to partnerships with various PSPs and aggregators and such, we have a really strong footprint in, in e-com. Okay. Um, so in terms of, uh, the health of the US consumer, the health of the consumer in general, you know, especially considering high, higher unemployment, furloughs, unemployment claims, you know, as we saw this morning, um, it's been remarkable how well the industry is faring right now. Um, you know, I noticed that Amex is, uh, credit quality is at its best point over the last 12 months on consumer, and, shockingly, its best point over the last three years in small business. And so maybe some context there be, you know, discovers, uh, CEO, uh, did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect the material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year, so just your perspective. Yeah. I mean, um, look, I think most issuers have seen a more modest impact than would have been implied by the end of Q1, qualitative reserves that they took, right? I think, looking at macro indicators around Unemployment Claims changes in sequential GDP. You know, uh, if you were sitting back being an armchair credit manager, you would have expected, um, much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write offs. And the fact of the matter is, as you say, we have, uh, we have not seen them as most issuers haven't play out of, by and large. Now, there are a number of contributors to that right, I would say the jobless claims, the geography of those the, the demographics of those jobless claims, you know, uh, uh, weren't as concentrated in our customer base, our member base, um, as the macro numbers would suggest. Uh, I would also say as everyone knows, there's just a ton of liquidity in the system right now, whether it's through government programs, private sector forbearance programs, um, and so you're right, we have, we have credit quality and delinquency and right off side that are better year on year, uh, than, uh, than they were, um, you know, I think we have to while, while we're pleased with that, we also have a healthy level of, you know, paranoia about what the next 12 months will bring, right? The macro economy, some of these forbearance programs with 10% of residential mortgages being in forbearance, that kind of going away government support, um, moderating, uh, perhaps private sector follow through in terms of white collar job losses. So, you know, we feel great about the early innings of this crisis, but you know, we're mindful that it's, it's not over. You know, just\\u2026 are there any signs in the portfolio at all, that would be concerning? You know, look, I think in the, in the commercial or small business portfolio, clearly, there are industries that are more affected by this. Fortunately, they tend to be industries where our concentration is, uh, is lower, you know, there, there are some, some things about this crisis have actually improved visibility in a way. I mean, we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors, right? Which allows us to kinda target and think about the precision of our underwriting and existing customer management, a little bit more crisply, but, but I would say there are, there are no real hotspots within the portfolio right now. You know, I, I would say, you know, back in April, May, all of us had these sort of short term crisis relief programs, right, where payment holiday, no interest charged, and, you know, type thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane, and we, we made a, uh, a judgment that we weren't gonna kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs. We were gonna, we were gonna move customers if they needed to move on to longer term solutions for repayment confidence, right? So our 12 month financial relief program, which, you know, allows customers to reduce their, uh, minimum payment, maintain their membership, they don't get their membership canceled, and retain some level of spend utility as well, right? And we think that, uh, that, that has allowed us to transition the portfolio, um, in a very customer friendly way, in a way that has stabilized the receivables metrics as well. Okay. Um, I wanna keep this\\u2026 try to keep this conversation with investors. So investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that, um, I'll just read it for you. Basically, you've made it clear that TNT spend recovery is very linked to COVID resolution. You know, as customers currently divert that spending toward non TNT purchases, how is Amex able to increase their share of customer spending in non TNT and how meaningfully can that move the needle on billings growth? Yeah. I mean, I think it's a great question. I mean, one of the things, you know we did early in this crisis is decide that we were gonna focus on existing customers. Um, the visibility around large scale prospect acquisition was challenged, our value propositions tend to index on TNT, as we've noted, and so we said job, one was taking care of existing customers, which caused us to make, um, a long term balance of year, um, large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant, right for the times type of value. And that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining, food delivery, our wireless and streaming credits on our, our platinum product promotions with Amazon and other, um, other merchant partners. And, you know, we're measuring success right now, in terms of how effectively we retain our customers, and especially the customers that drive 50 to 60% of our margin on an annual basis, and how well, we compete within their wallets per share of wallet. And on both of those metrics, which we track very closely. And at a very granular level, we feel really good about how well we're competing, uh, for our customers' business. And, you know, I think we've, we've built some confidence here that, you know, as certain natural hedges in our business take effect, so people aren't visiting lounges as much. It, it frees up resources for us to create new, more relevant value for our customers. That's what we did this year, it has worked for us so far, uh, we're in the early innings. Um, and we're confident that we can and we'll do that going forward as well. You know, we also just need to, I think, think about we, we think about our co-brand products as like travel products. Actually, like 90% of the spend on a number of our large co-brands is in non TNT categories, right? What they're doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future. And so that billing base isn't as effective as long as consumers believe in the long term value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can, they can gain access to. So it sounds like you're implying that the co-branded portfolios or performing the travel related co-brand portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios? Yeah. There are, um, they're performing no worse than other portfolios. Look, there are portfolios that we have that are doing extraordinarily well, right, certain real a\\u2026 retail co-brands, whether it's the small business co-brand with Amazon, whether it's other department store co-brands we have outside of the US, um, but if you were to look at our US, uh, certainly our cashback products as all cashback products in the industry, that rational shore value is performing very well. But I think we've been on record saying, you know, say our delta portfolio has experienced a more modest compression of billings, than our US portfolios at large. Interesting. Um, well count me one of those co-brand, uh, holders with Delta. Uh, hopefully I get to use some of those miles at some point soon. I think my family would appreciate that <laugh>. That, that's the pent up demand I'm talking about right? We all feel that way. Oh, I see <crosstalk>. Haven't seen my father in six months. It's there. It's definitely there. Um, so, okay. Um, let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly, Amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems. Amex has historically, um, kept their spending levels and sup, and supportive consumers at a higher level through crisis and I think that's because of the returns Amex has via the network. So have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what's been the response? Yeah. You know, I am\\u2026 they, they always say crisis, uh, build character. They like reveal character to both individuals and institutions, and I've been around Amex a long time. Um, I'm very proud of the way we've kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis. I mean, in the times of greatest uncertainty, uh, we signed up for an extraordinary level of value injection, both the product level value I described as well as what we've done with our three month shop small program, um, when we had our least visibility, we doubled down on, uh, on our customers. Um, and as I said earlier, I think it's paid real dividends for us we track, um, spend share within our members wallets, and there's no question that back in like, April, we took a hit, and we have climbed back, um, as a result of that value injection, and some really dialed up customer, uh, marketing. Um, as I think Steve and Jeff have both said, we see, uh, retention rates that are superior, to 2019 right now within our base. And, you know, I think we've talked about it before. They're better than they were in 2019. And our retention rates in general, are just extraordinarily high. I mean, we, we retain more than 98% of our billings base year to year. Okay. I don't, I don't think I've heard that stat before. So that's a\\u2026 it's definitely a good one to write down. Um, so, uh, wanted to ask about lending, lending\\u2026 Amex is getting more creative. And its lending products, there was recently, uh, a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum. Um, so maybe you can discuss how Amex is expanding its lending if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet, which I believe historically was about half that of the spend share? Yes. So if you can dig into that a little bit, that'd be great. Yeah. So you, your memory is really good. Uh, you know, typically, we have mid 40s. Um, spend share, and we have, uh, low 20s, uh, lending share within our customers. You know, I think there's, there's kind of legacy point of view that our customers don't borrow on credit cards, but our customers tend to account for about a third of the industry billings on credit, and about a third of industry outstandings on credit. Um, and we believe that our customers, um, uh, expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products. And, you know, we have been growing if you look back 2019 in the three years previous we probably grow, grew at 2x the industry rate, at least some, some years 3x the industry rate in terms of, uh, lending volumes. There was a lot of investor concern, the analysts concern at the time about could we do that prudently? Would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that or was there a surprise? Uh, a surprise looming. One of the things we've said and we remain committed to it is, you know, we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base, right? Whether that's installment capabilities, term loans, or some of the new features you've described. And for us, they're important because not only do customers expect them, but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can reinvest into highly competitive value propositions. So yes, we have put both revolve and transaction based installment capabilities on our full US consumer product stuff. So historic green, gold, platinum. Um, and we'll be working through a process of introducing those features, uh, to our members in the current quarters. We wanna make sure that, you know, we don't sound tone deaf in terms of the marketing we're doing and what new features we're introducing, um, but we believe customers expect that and on installment in particular, I'm really enthusiastic about that, right? There's a financial discipline to these closed end installment programs, and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting used to kind of installment and put sale type capabilities. Yeah. Lemme ask you about that because, uh, that's, it's a hot market, it's hard to understand how much it's really penetrated, uh, US credit, um, it seems that the barriers are lower, when it comes to an e-commerce transaction. For instance, uh, we believe that a firm will be available to every Shopify merchant at the product level, as opposed to just the checkout level, um, on those websites, so maybe you can discuss for a minute how you're thinking about those products, perhaps leaping in front of Amex's ability to lend to its customer because of the placement. Yeah. Well, I think you know, the good thing about, um, about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale, knowing it's available to them. And it introduces zero friction in checkout, right? Because on the back end, on their app, they can opt into a plan of three, six, 12 months in duration, with very transparent fees associated with it. Um, so I think, as opposed to having eng, to engage in the purchase that\\u2026 but I think there are a lot of things a firm and Shopify, others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight, reduced friction there. Um, but you can't get less friction than we have in that, um, purchase experience. I also think it's a platform that's, um, has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with our partners, right? So if you think about our airline and hotel partners, and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it, um, you know, uh, on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that, but also to drive card acquisition saying a Delta purchase path, we think it has powerful potential. Okay. All right. Um, on the card portfolios, Amex has done, um, since Steve took over, Amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles, which has had a profound impact on the rate of growth in net card fees. Yeah. And so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical new customer account acquisition you expect off of a refresh, that might cause, um, a slowdown in those fees, and then a re-acceleration at some point? Yeah. So I think we have done a really good job of that, you know, we exited ' 19 with north of 20% card fee, uh, growth. Um, and you know, this year, right before the pandemic hit, we actually refreshed our entire Delta, uh, co-brand portfolio and priced for the value in that. Um, so I would say the, the pandemic has affected a couple areas. Um, you know, I think it's affected our acquisition bonds as I said, in Q2, we decided to focus on existing customers. We pulled back on acquisition, that definitely slows the flow of new fee paying, uh, customers. I think there may be examples where we refresh products and have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh, or whether we defer that fee increase for 12 months. I think we're gonna have to be sensitive to the environment, but in terms of the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh, adding value and pricing for that value, both on the back and the front book. We remain committed to that. And I think you should expect that, um, regardless of the environment, that 2021 will feature some large scale refreshes as well. Okay. Um, I wanna ask you about all the work you've done to support your co-brand partners, especially in TNT. And do you have concern around, you know, you see some of these announcements that I'm not sure if they're threats, or if they're real, when a United goes out and says We're getting ready to lay off 50% of our domestic staff. Um, Delta has clearly not said anything like that. But point is, how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed? And how's Amex thinking about that? Yeah. Well, I mean I\\u2026 fundamentally, I view them as, as under stress, as we all are, but since I do believe in the return, especially of leisure travel, um, on the back of a vaccine, I believe in the long term, uh, of those partners as well. I also happen to think we have, we have great partners. We have a really premium set of partners, whether it's Delta, whether it's Hilton, whether it's British Airways, who we just react with, um, uh, and, you know, my, my view as it was in, you know, the great financial crisis was, these are great times to, to lean in build partnership, and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base. And that's what we've done right? If you look at the value injections, we've done with Delta that we've done with Marriott that we've done with Hilton, and these are partners that as you say, they're under a fair amount of stress, and they have come to the table, uh, innovated with us co-invested to, to make those products appealing even in a travel challenge time. And I think you'll see, you'll see more of that in, uh, in ' 21. I feel, um, I feel great about the long term health of those portfolios, and I feel really good about the partners. Okay. We've got a minute and I really wanted to give you a chance to answer, um, Amex has really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up. Razzie, Mezi, cake, pocket concierge, uh, lounge buddy, you know, to name a bunch, how is that all coming together to support your customers? Are we gonna see significant changes to the American Express mobile app, which I think is the best in the industry as it is, to bring those capabilities to bear? Yeah. It's a great, it's a great question. And it's one that's live on our minds as well. Um, and, you know, I mean, the most recent capability based acquisition would have been cabbage on the small business side, right? mm-hmm <affirmative>. Um, and, you know, we have been on the journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences, uh, like dining has always been top passionate for our customers, right? Um, it's, you know, we have a billion dining transactions, it's the number one request into our concierge and travel. And so digitizing and adding content there, um, was sort of a no brainer to us. But your, your point is, right. We have seen through the digitization of our products and servicing, a material drop in offline service. A large shift to online, and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of 35, 80% of our acquisitions happen in digital channels. And so that trend, plus the content we're adding, right, so you add dining, you add installment type capabilities, you add, you know, new SME product sets, you know, our mobile product and web product are gonna have to flex to make that expanded range of content easier to navigate for folks. There's no question but to your point, I think we feel like we started a really, uh, strong place, right in terms of, uh, our own internal assessment, as well as external recognition of, of our mobile product. mm-hmm <affirmative>. Well, I'm gonna have to wrap it there. Doug, I really appreciate you joining us. I really want to do this in person next time <laugh>. And- Next do that. E, en, en, enjoy the last fleeting days of summer. All right. You too Craig. Great to see you. Thank you. Thanks. Take care Doug. All right. Bye.\",\n          \"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the conference call to discuss the definitive agreement for Illumina to acquire GRAIL. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone keypad. You will be limited to one question. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. Thank you. And I'd like to hand the conference over to your moderator for today. Jacquie Ross, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on such short notice to discuss the definitive agreement for Illumina to acquire GRAIL. If you've not had a chance to review today's release, it can be found in the investor relations section of our website at Illumina.com. Participating for Illumina today will be Francis deSouza president and Chief Executive Officer, and Sam Samad, Chief Financial Officer. We're also pleased to welcome Hans Bishop, GRAIL's chief executive officer. Francis, Hans, and Sam we'll share some prepared remarks, and then we will open the call for some questions. This call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the investor section of our website. Today's presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed. Please review the cautionary statements and other important information for investors and stockholders on slide two. With that, I'll turn the call over to Francis. Thanks Jacquie. Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us on such short notice. I'm excited to share that earlier this morning, we announced an agreement to acquire GRAIL and to work together, to launch a new era in cancer detection. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the GRAIL team for what they've accomplished. We spun out GRAIL four years ago to focus on an ambitious goal, to revolutionize the way we detect cancer by developing a blood test that could find cancer earlier than is possible today. Their innovation and results since then have exceeded even our lofty expectations. Setting the stage for early cancer detection to likely be the largest genomic application over the next 15 years by far. This combination will be transformative for cancer detection. The acquisition will enable GRAIL to leverage Illumina's global commercial, clinical and operations capabilities, accelerating their mission and allowing us to impact more people faster than they might've done alone. Illumina's next generation sequencers will continue to support genomic medicine to become standard of care across clinical applications. And with this acquisition, we will accelerate and participate more fully indirectly in the highest value clinical opportunity enabled by our technology. Specifically the acquisition positions Illumina to participate in what we expect will be a $75 billion market for NGS based oncology tests by 2035, 60 billion higher than our oncology TAM excluding GRAIL. Cancer is one of the greatest threats to human health. Despite the significant investments made and the important medical advancements achieved so far when we diagnose cancer too late, when it is metastatic, less than 20% of patients will survive more than five years. In contrast, if we diagnose cancer early, approximately 90% of patients are expected to survive beyond five years. About 71% of cancer related deaths are attributable to cancers with no recommended screening tests. And with limited screening tests, cancer is more likely to be detected in the late stages and or more often than not too late. This is both a human tragedy and an enormous burden  on the healthcare system. Each year, there are over 600,000 cancer related deaths in the US and approximately 10 million deaths worldwide, making it the second leading cause of death. We spend approximately $250 billion per year on cancer in the US and globally the econo-\\u2026 the annual economic impact is more than $1.20 trillion. And now for the first time, there is a technology platform that enables us to address this burden. Starting with GRAIL's, multi cancer detection test Galleri, which aims to reduce cancer deaths by transforming how and when cancer is detected. GRAILs technology characterizes the DNA that cancer cells shed into the blood detecting unique signatures that identify both the presence and often the tissue of origin of the cancer. Earlier this year, GRAIL shared positive results from it's Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas or CPGA study that has enrolled 15,000 participants. The study found that the first version of Galleri reported sensitivity of 44% for stage one through three tumors, for 50 different cancers, and 67% sensitivity for the 12 deadliest cancers. And in 93% of the positive results, the test correctly identified the tissue of origin, all with a specificity of greater than 99% and from a single blood drop. Arguably, one of the most important performance measures for doctors and payers is the Positive Predictive Value or PPV, which is the percentage of positive tests that <inaudible> cancers. For Galleri, we predict a PPV 43%. This represents the very significant step forward compared to today's most commonly used screening tests, which often have a PPV in the range of 3% to 5%. The GRAIL team is preparing to launch Galleri as a Lab Developed Test or LDT in 202. We believe that this is a remarkable advance in the ability to detect cancer earlier, which can transform cancer care and improve population health. As noted earlier, most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of slide six. The limitations of current screening methods lead to only 31% of cancers being identified in stages one and two, when they're the most treatable. Based on GRAIL's studies, this could increase to 82% with broad adoption of Galleri's blood tests, complimenting today's recommended cancer screening. This matters, because if we mentioned earlier, survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected. Broad adoption of Galleri could avert nearly 40% of the five-year cancer mortality on around 100,000 deaths annually in the US. My apologies for the technical issues, we will pick up again from slide six. As noted earlier, most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars and the charts on the left half of slide six.

Based on GRAIL's studies this could increase to 82% with broad adoption of Galleri's blood tests, complimenting today's recommended screening. This matters, because as we mentioned earlier, survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected. Broader adoption of Galleri could avert nearly 40% of the five-year cancer mortality or around 100,000 deaths annually in the US. To put this in perspective, it roughly matches the number of deaths prevented by all current screening, testing, treatment and surgery standards combined. Once available, we are confident that Galleri will enable screening for more cancers than ever before. While screening has improved for some cancers, including lung, breast, colorectal, and cervical, we know that roughly six in 10 cancers diagnosed in 12 million cases and five million deaths a year are associated with cancers with no recommended treating requirements. Since Galleri will help discover cancer earlier, we believe that Galleri can help detect three times as many cancers when added to recommend single cancer screenings. There is significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and the potential impact on families and communities highlights the importance of GRAIL's work. We will also be able to better meet the needs of healthcare providers and delivery systems. By improving the overall efficiency as cancer detection payers, will be able to realize the lower costs associated with the treatment of cancer at earlier stages. Based on GRAIL's estimates, the adoption of Galleri alongside existing screening guidelines could help reduce diagnostic workup costs by up to 65%. These benefits are key drivers in the market potential, which we anticipate reflects an addressable market for NGS based oncology testing of $75 billion. Today, we're seeing rapid adoption of NGS's based therapy selection, tests, many based on Illumina's technology. Over the next 15 years we expect this market to grow in the CAGR of about 16% to $14 billion, to an annual 7 million test opportunity at approximate ASD of $1,300 to $2,300.0. Illumina participates in the therapy selection market with our TSO 500 tests currently available for research use only, and making its way through regulatory approval for commercial launch in early 202. As the reimbursement landscape continues to strengthen and drives utilization of therapy selection tests, we're seeing more companies working on monitoring tests that will assess the activity of a patient's cancer. This can optimize the disease management and determine the effectiveness of cancer therapies for individual patients. These assays can also act as surveillance tests for cancer patients who have completed therapy and are in remission. We expect this market to grow with a CAGR of about 27% to 15 billion in 203. The test opportunity here is expected to grow to about 20 million tests per year, with an expected ASP of $700 to $1,000.0. The cancers screening opportunity, it's significantly larger in therapy selection and monitoring combined. This market is expected to grow quickly to about 150 million tests in 2035, a 75% CAGR to approximately $46 billion. Let's assume that ASP that starts around $1,200 and trends to about $300 in 2035, as we scale and drive adoption with increasingly accessible pricing. With regards to the market for Galleri specifically, there is a sizable addressable market of over 100 billion people between the age of 50 to 79 in the US. We believe approximately half of this addressable market is accessible with Galleri prior to reimbursement. The GRAIL go-to market strategy next year will consist of three core channels, health symptoms, self-insured employers and concierge medicine. Given the cost improvement potential, we feel that health system and self-insured employers will recognize the compelling value propositions and drive adoption of the first multi-cancer detection LDT available. There's also an opportunity in concierge medicine. Segment that typically caters to health conscious members that like to be on the forefront of new medical technologies who could be early adopters of Galleri. We expect that GRAIL will launch Galleri is 2021, we'll look forward to additional results next year from the CCGA stuff, study three and Pathfinder to further support the clinical validation of Galleri. Additionally, GRAIL will continue to work on its Diagnostic Aid for Cancer tests, or DAC which is intended for symptomatic patients and is designed to speed up the time to diagnosis when cancer is suspected. And GRAIL also has the Minimal Residual Disease or MRD test in development, intended for patients who have been diagnosed and treated to detect persistent disease, following definitive therapy. On that note, I'd like to invite Hans the CEO of GRAIL to say a few words. Thank you, Francis. I'm excited to be here today. Let me start by recognizing the accomplishments of the GRAIL team. We're a mission driven company focused on detecting cancer early when it can be cured. We believe our early cancer detection tele-\\u2026 technology could substantially reduce the burden of cancer worldwide. And it developed unique technology that preferentially targets the most informative regions of the genome, and uses machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor tissue of origin. We believe by joining forces with Illumina, we'll achieve scales faster, preventing more late stage cancer diagnoses. We are strongly positioned with our first two conventional product launches expected in 202. And once our deal closes, we'll be able to leverage the global scale and reach of Illumina through relationships and in-country infrastructure to further our commercialization efforts. Simply put sales mission and focus will not change, but Illumina's international footprint and expertise across market access regulatory government affairs and manufacturing will accelerate our ability to realize our mission and goals of improve patient outcomes. We built a world-class team of data and computer scientists at the forefront of applying AI to genomics and were better to serve or leverage those capabilities for the benefit of human health <inaudible>. In the process, we've also established an impressive IP portfolio with more than 230 patents granted globally, and another 170 pending patent applications. With 115,000 participants enrolled and another 30,000 plans, GRAIL has built one of the largest population scale clinical trial programs ever pursued in genomic medicine. GRAIL's genomic database continues to grow with each task and additional clinical trial participant. And today stands at over 12.6 petabytes worth of genomic data. The comparison, which is five times larger than the cancer genome Atlas. Illumina remains the most innovative company in sequencing and GRAILs' ability to keep pushing the boundaries of what possible\\u2026 is what's possible to keep finding more and more cancers earlier stages will be further strengthened as a result of this combination. Having spent time with Francis and the Illumina team, I'm confident we all share the same goal and we're committed to accelerating our mission and delivering on our promise faster than could be done alone. We both believe this is a case where one plus one will equal well over two. And with that, I'd like to hand the call back to Francis. Thanks Han. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to work with the GRAIL team to accelerate adoption of their life-saving products by leveraging our global commercial, clinical, and operations capability. On global commercial organization, market sales and supports <unk> 6,600 customers in 115 countries, including a number of national population scale genomics program powered by Illumina sequencing technology. Illumina first established our clinical lab in 200. And since then have added two more, including one in the UK to support Genomics England and the NHS. This certified and accredited labs are staff by more than 250 team members, including board certified pathologists, medical geneticists, genetic counselors, and PhD scientists. Over the last five years, our lab has processed, more than 17 million or RASs and almost one million clinical samples. We've also expanded our clinical capabilities and built-out world-class marching access, government affairs and regulatory functions. In addition, our clinical grade development and manufacturing team delivered systems and kits registered for IVD use in more than 35 countries around the world. And at the same time, we've been extending our reach into the clinical market, through partnerships with leading clinical companies, including BMS, Celgene and Roche. As Illumina and GRAIL come together we accelerate adoption of clinical NGS based testing. This will have a positive impact on our business. Over time, more of our revenue will reflect the clinical value of our NGS products, and not only the underlying sequencing output. As a result, Illumina will play a direct role in accelerating the adoption of genomic medicine, in addition to enabling it. As we evolve, Illumina remains committed to all of our customers and partners. We're dedicated to delivering the most innovative sequeing\\u2026 sequencing systems as consumables to our customers and partners. There's still so much important research to be done. And we know this will be enabled in part by continued innovation in sequencing. And on the clinical side, our mission has always been improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. We will continue to enable our clinical customers to scale as they do work towards the shared goal. With that, let me hand things over to Sam for a quick review of financial terms and impact. Thanks Francis. As announced earlier today, we have agreed to acquire GRAIL for total cash and stock consideration of $8 billion, with additional payments linked with certain product sales over the first 12 years. This acquisition expands the Illumina's market opportunity by more than $60 billion. It allows us to participate in the clinical markets more fully, and it will contribute to revenue growth starting modestly in 2021 and meaningfully accelerate over time. We expect the transaction flows in the second half of 2021, and we will share more detailed expectations about revenue growth and impact on EPS when that happens. Cash and stock consideration is $8 billion. Since Illumina currently owns 12% of GRAIL's equity on a fully excluded basis, the purchase price is approximately $7 billion to GRAIL's other shareholders. As part of the transaction, Illumina will pay GRAIL's shareholders, approximately $4 billion in common stock, which is subject to a collar. The number of shares issued be based on penetrate volume, weighted average price of Illumina common stock, 10 days prior to close. Moreover, the stock consideration collar ensures the final number of shares the GRAIL shareholders received is derived from a price that will be within a share price band of $295 and $399.0. The remaining $3.10 billion cash consideration is expected to be funded with balance sheet cash and up to an additional $1 billion raised either through equity or debt. We have a $1 billion fully committed bridge file with Goldman Sachs, and sure funding availability. The last component of the deal includes contingent payment rights to GRAIL's shareholders based on GRAIL related revenues for a 12-year period. Specifically a 2.50% payment right, is applied to the first $1 billion of revenue each year and all revenue above that would be subject to a 9% payment right to GRAIL's shareholders. With that, back to Francis. Thank you, Sam. When we created GRAIL in 2016, we knew that its mission was a moonshot, but an important one. One that would have significant ramifications for the detection of cancer successful, positively impacting millions of lives and opening a massive market opportunity. We wanted to see the technology progress as fast as possible, create the largest political trials and get it to patients in years not decades. It was clear that the best way to do this and capitalize the effort was as a separate company with this singular focus and an extraordinary team that could execute quickly. Illumina has set it up for success by seeding it with technology and some of our best and brightest. Four years later, GRAIL has proven the skeptics wrong and is now at the pre-commercial stage. It was a big bet and it paid off. Over the last four and a half years, GRAIL has raised almost $2 billion to fund its mission. During the same period, Illumina generated about $4 billion in EBITDA. GRAIL's mission is no longer a moonshot and we believe that it's poised to transform cancer detection. Our mission at Illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. This hasn't changed in over the last 22 years. We began our journey by launching our micro-array based services and products. Our breakthrough arrays offered higher throughput, lower costs, more flexibility, and higher quality than existing technologies. And we became the leading micro-array vendor by 2006, more than doubling revenues from the previous year. While we enjoyed the success, we saw the opportunity to take the next step forward towards our mission through sequencing. <inaudible> going away and in 2020, we still have an array business, but we saw the potential for enormous and very elastic research market fired by high quality lower cost sequencing. So in 2006, we acquired Solexa, sequencing technology company with no revenue for $600 million. A third of our market cap at the time. The market was initially skeptical, but we began the race to the $1,000 genome. And over the last 14 years, the vision has proved right. We reduced the cost of high quality sequencing of a genome from $150,000 in 2007 to $600 today. Enabling groundbreaking genomic discoveries, including circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood and the impact of rare variants on cancer therapy response. By 2014, when we delivered the industry's first $1,000 genome, our research sequencing business was thriving. And once again, we sense we were entering a new era of genomics entering the clinic. In 2013, we acquired Verinata, a provider of non-invasive prenatal testing. In December of 2013, we received the first ever FDA authorization for our next generation sequencer. We embarked on our own multi-year clinical transformation building out the capabilities I referenced earlier. Today, our clinical business therapy, selection and oncology and IDT and genetic disease testing account for half of our sequencing consumable revenues. We're now entering the next phase of genomics, sequencing to the standard of care. Early cancer detection represents the largest genomic application by far, we believe over the next decade. Because cancer screening impacts a very large part of the population, <inaudible> is in an era where regular genomic testing is the norm for a population. We accelerate this vision by acquiring GRAIL. Before we open up to Q and A, I wanna summarize a few things. First, excluding GRAIL for a moment, we remain confident in our business and excited by the opportunity ahead. We expect to continue as the leading innovator in sequencing supporting both research and clinical customers. GRAIL is not replacing anything and as such the acquisition will be additive to Illumina's opportunity and growth. We consider early cancer detection to be one of the largest clinical opportunities for the next 15 years. And we believe we will accelerate global adoption by participating more directly. Second, this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to extend it to the clinical market, the fastest growing opportunity in sequencing. We will continue to deliver sequencing systems and consumables and remain committed to the relentless pursuit of sequencing innovation, to democratize access and realize the potential of this technology to positively impact human health. Third we spun out GRAIL four years ago on a moonshot mission, the terrific progress they made has de-risked the mission over time. Now that they stand poised to bring products to market in 2021, we believe this is the right time to bring the GRAIL team into Illumina, so that we can help to commercialize and accelerate its adoption. In closing, our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome and GRAIL's mission in detect cancer early when it can be cured could not be more consistent. We look forward to accelerating the age of genomic medicine together. With that I'll invite the operator to begin the Q and A. Certainly. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one. Again, you will be limited to one question. Doug Schenkel with Cowen, your line is open. Morning. Um, so- so GRAIL is clearly a- a really exciting and promising asset. And- and you did a great job this morning, outlining, uh, a lot of that. Um, and you were very comprehensive in explaining, uh, why you wanna do this deal. I'm, I'm actually hoping that you could address how you got comfortable overcoming some of the reasons not to do the deal. These include three things that would be really helpful for you to address. The first is the challenge of competing with customers, which has been an issue for you in the past and something you talked about avoidance. So, um, first off, wondering how you expect to manage that and why the change, why the pivot there. Second the- the dilution associated with this deal, um, which could create a potential internal P and L conflict when it comes to incentive structure, not to mention an issue with investor valuation methodologies. Um, I think this is part of the reason your stock got hit so much last week in anticipation of this announcement. So how do you handle potential P and L conflict internal and externally moving forward? And then third, so the lack of clear clinical operating synergies. Um, and- and how you plan to succeed as a clinical development company in a way that you haven't in the past. We know that Illumina is great at certain things that especially developing leading genetic tools platforms and having an amazing, uh, commercial team in place to support, not just the placement of these platforms, but how users use them. That said, while you've been great as an arms dealer to clinical customers, your track record isn't as strong when it comes to developing and selling assays and getting them through regulatory and reimbursement pathways. So- so what are the clinical synergies and how do you quantify them. Again, one, how do you manage the competing with customers? Two, how do you manage the P and L conflict internal and externally? And third, why should we get excited about this given the lack of clear clinical operating synergies? Thank you. Sure. Uh, thank you, Doug. So let's go through each of those. The first one is how do we manage the challenge of competing with our customers. And our strategy there continues to be that in the vast majority of applications, uh, in the market that we serve, we will look to our customers and our partners to develop the applications, and our sequencers and consumables. And that's gonna be to the vast majority of applications. What we've said, however, is that for a very small set of applications where- where we felt the market was large, and we felt that there was a differentiated offering that we could put into the market. And we would, uh, we would enter that market directly. In those markets, we still enable our customers and partners to create a competing offering. So we continue to support everybody. But we said in the very large markets where we felt we had a differentiated capability to bring into the market we would enter those. And you've seen us do that, for example, in the NIPT space where we brought innovations and intellectual property into that market, and I've put together an end to end solution. You saw us do that in the large cancer panels, like the 500 gene panel, TSO 50. And now you're seeing us do that here. In this case, we feel that the criteria we use have been met, this is a very large, uh, uh, application for us. We think that over the next 15 years, it could potentially be the largest genomics application in the market in terms of, uh, addressable market size. And the GRAIL team has put together a very differentiated offering. There's a lot of innovation, a lot of IP that was created, Hans talked about the 230 applications of patents that have been granted and 170 more that have been filed. So there is a very differentiated offering. And in this case, you know, with GRAIL pioneering the market, you know, they're sort of leading the way in creating that market. And so as we looked at the market, we felt it meets the criteria for one of the very small set of markets that we would get into directly. We're gonna continue though to- to enable our customers and partners to create their own offerings in this market too. So that's how we thought about, you know, that question. The next question was around dilution and how we got comfortable with that and how we to manage P and L costs. And so the thinking here is that we're gonna manage GRAIL as a, as a separate division. And we get a report really transparent about, uh, the P and L of GRAIL. And we manage that differently and separately from the P and L for the rest of the business. And we understand the profile of what it'll take to get GRAIL successful in the market going forward. And so we'll be very transparent about what that looks like. Now we expect that to be dilutive for the next few years, but then because of the size of the opportunity, we expect it to be, uh, highly accretive as this\\u2026 as we start to scale the offering in the later years. And- and again, we'll be very transparent about sharing what that looks like. Longterm, we have a high confidence in the- the P and L attractiveness of this business, but we do know it takes investment in the first few years. And the next question was about, you know, clinical synergy. So what are the synergies that, you know, GRAIL will enjoy coming into Illumina? And as you know, we've been building out our clinical capabilities since 2000\\u2026 201. And so today, for example, you know, we have a number of places where we think gra- uh, GRAIL can benefit, you know, as soon as they come in. Uh, some of the things we talked about on the call. One, for example, that we're engaged with over 50 population sequencing efforts around the world. Uh, today, we're talking to them about oncology therapy selection, genetic disease diagnosis. Um, we think it's a very natural add to expand the conversation, to include, uh, you know, cancer screening and early detection. We think it'd be very valuable in conversations we're in. So we'll be able to immediately scale up a number of conversations that GRAIL is having around the world. We talked about our clinical lab. Um, we have among the largest, uh, clinical genomics labs in the world. We have, uh, two in the US, one in the UK. Those labs have already processed over a million clinical samples and build the workflows and expertise necessary to do that. And then we've also built, uh, you know, the regulatory capabilities, the market access capabilities, uh, in-country surveillance capabilities to support clinical offerings around the world. Today, we have IVEs that are cleared in 35 countries around the world, leveraging relationships. We build with the regulatory bodies in those countries, as well as having a market sur- surveillance capability from those countries. And you can see that playing out in the success of products that we've bought on the market like our VeriSeq NIPT product, which is CE- IVD marked and doing really well in EMEA. So those are some of the clinical capabilities, and frankly, we spend the last five plus years building that GRAIL plugs into immediately. Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Hey, thanks. Uh, a couple of quick ones. So, you know, your- your stock lost 20 billion in market cap list last week, because alluded to\\u2026 you know, did that influence your thinking and what is it that you think the street doesn't fully understand here? You know, especially given this as a pretty significant, I think about a $4 billion step up since the last round GRAIL did in May. And why is buying it all now the right approach, given that you could have taken your equity stake up higher, maybe to 40%, 50% healthy IPO and then, you know, had a call option to buy it later. So that's the first question. Second on margins. Can you give us a sense of where COGs can go? You know, we know you have off the shelf technology for $100 genome. So how much of this is about driving down COGs quickly and then where do you think they can go? And then how much do you think GRAIL needs to spend on R&D and the sales force ramp, uh, to- to really scale up. Third, you know, Francis, you talked about, uh, you know, uh, uh, competence in- in the core business. You know, I think one of the things investor is gonna worry about is- is, you know, uh, you know, concerns about growth in the core business or maybe, you know, you're doing this deal to- to diversify and cover up, you know, continued to slow down. So can you maybe talk to what you think, uh, about the core business for next year, a little bit more quantitatively. And then lastly, you know, either for Francis or Hans, you know, why is a 44% sensitivity for a screen test, you know, of clinical value, especially at the price that's been- been talked about. Thank you. Thank you, Tycho. All right. Uh, a lot of ground to cover. So I'm gonna start by talking about your first question, which is the why now question. And then Sam I'm gonna turn it over to you to talk, uh, about the margins question, and then I'll come back and talk about our core business. And then, uh, and then I'll look to- to you Hans maybe also to comment a little bit around the- the screening tests and the clinical value. So let's start. Um, so why now? Um, and- and- and was there any sort of reaction in our mind you're asking around the stock drop <inaudible>. So the reason for why now, uh, and- and frankly, we took a longer-term view. So the events of last week didn't really impact our why now decision. Uh, and I'll, I'll talk about that a little bit. The- the reason for why now is, uh, frankly, the terrific progress that the GRAIL team has made over the last few years and where they stand right now. When we spun out GRAIL four years ago, you'll remember how this idea got started, right? So we were processing samples, uh, for NIPT and our clinical labs. And although we were seeing normal, uh, you know, fetal DNA, we noticed abnormalities in the mother's DNA. And so we reported that to the doctor and in all of those cases, it turned out that the mother had cancer and didn't know about it. And so we incubated\\u2026 So there was a, there was an idea that you could get signals for cancer in the blood. And we incubated that idea without a team for a couple of years to feel like there was something there, but there was a lot of unknowns. It was unclear whether there was enough signal to detect early stage cancer. It was unclear whether you could just detect only certain types of cancer. It was unclear if the approach we were thinking about was the right approach. And so what we wanted was to- to create a company that was going after this- this, uh, this moonshot mission, uh, that could be focused on that move quickly on that. So we also wanted to know maybe other approaches in the market would- would be more fruitful. The team has done a fantastic job over the last four years and sort of <inaudible> a lot of the questions. The- the technology they put together, the team they've assembled, and then probably most importantly, the results they're demonstrating from their large scale clinical studies have put to bed a lot of the questions that we had. You know, the- the Galleri results I talked about based on the CCGA samples show that, you know, they are able to identify over 50- 50 types of cancer, that they have a specificity that, that means the FALSE of 99%, that the FALSE positive rate of less than 1%. They won't flood, you know, health care systems with FALSE positives. Um, and they have high sensitivity, especially for the deadliest cancers. And so they stand today on the precipice of commercializing a product next year. And so now- now it makes a lot of sense for us to- to acquire them. And so why a part of you are asking why not just increase our investment. And the reason to acquire them is because we have very clear line of sight into how we can accelerate a plan that they are on today. And we can only do that if they're part of Illumina. Plugging them into our commercial, uh, conversations with population sequencing efforts, for example. Standing them up in our clinical labs around the world, rather than waiting for them to build out their own clinical labs, plugging into our regulatory expertise in countries around the world. All of those things are things that we can do with their part of Illumina and frankly we wouldn't be able to do as well, even if we were a 30%, 40% owner off of GRAIL. And so, you know, they are\\u2026 you know, they- they talk about launching the product next year, so they're close to ma-\\u2026 commercialization. So it's exactly the right time we felt where there is a product, you know, the value has been demonstrated and they're ready to scale. And that's where we can help from an operational perspective, from a clinical perspective, from a commercial perspective. In terms of the stock drop, you know, uh, we've seen before, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that this is a big step. I understand that. This is also a big amount, I understand that. And, you know, we've, we've had this happened to us before, when we were in the array business and we wanted to get into sequencing. And we announced that we were acquiring the Solexa to get into the sequencing business. Uh, our stock dropped that day too. And- and it took a while for us to work with- with the market to explain where we were going and why we thought that was a big opportunity. And of course, you know, today that's been enormously successful story and sequencing is the vast majority of our revenues. And so, you know, we anticipated that there'd be work for us to do and explaining this step and explaining the opportunity and explaining why GRAIL and why GRAIL and Illumina. And that's the work we have in front of us, but we're very confident that it's the right next step in terms of fulfilling our mission. With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Sam for you to talk about margins and the questions Tycho had. Yeah. So I'll tackle a couple of things here, margins, and I think you had a question on operating expenses as well, Tycho. So, uh, you know, from an overall COGs standpoint, uh, the COGs will initially start out, you know, obviously much higher than our average cost driven by the fact that, you know, volumes are ramping up. So initially you're gonna see a higher cost profile for the business as the volume start ramping up though. And two and a half to three years post launch of Galleri, the COGs starts to get to a level which is commensurate with our overall services business and, uh, slightly below our overall COGs profile. And, uh, obviously as we introduce more innovations and, you know, uh, lower the cost of sequencing to your question, uh, the COGs will benefit from that as well. Just like our, all of our customers will benefit from that. Um, in terms of operating expenses, you know, if you look at, um, what, um, uh, what the\\u2026 GRAIL invested last year or- or this year I should. For the first month it was roughly $135 million. If you extrapolate that for the full year, let's say it's, uh, you know, it's exactly double that, it's about 270 million for the full year. As we look forward, obviously that number is gonna grow because we're gonna be ramping and launching, uh, products. We're gonna be accelerating the commercialization efforts and building out a sales force. Uh, and there's gonna be continuing R&D as well. So, you know, OPEX, especially in three years, there's gonna be, uh, you know\\u2026 I've backed on dilution, you know? but, uh, let me remind you of the\\u2026 just the attractiveness of this opportunity longer term, and eventually as the volume scale, uh, the- the opportunity is significant on the top line. And even though it requires investments in terms of commercial efforts in R&D, you know, we will definitely, uh, after a few years start to see accretion on P&L. And then maybe Hans you comment on the- the clinical value and the questions around this screening test and where we are? Sure. So- so as you, as you noted Tycho, um, the, uh, sensitivity for 50 cancers is 44%. So le- let me explain why we think this is quite through performance. Um, Francis touched on the fact that when we pre-specified a basket of 12 cancers, we have sensitivity of just under, uh, uh, 70% and those 12 cancers by the way, account for about two thirds of the mortality. Um, what you're observing is when you stop looking for more cancers in those 12, and you start adding in cancers where the test has lower sensitivity, the sensitivity does drop, but here's what matters, even though the sensitivity drops as you expand the absolute number of cancers, you look for the total number of cancers, you detect goes up. So a test looking for 50 cancers at 44% sensitivity in aggregate detect many more cancers and a test looking for 12 cancers at a 67% sensitivity. And when you think about medical need, we all have, you know, 70% of deaths in this country from cancer, occurring cancers, where there is no screening. This test will detect the vast majority of those. So- so that, that's why it's the right thing to have a test that can really detect the maximum number of cancers possible. Thank you, Hans. And then your last question Tycho was, you know, is- is this move any reflection of how we think about the core market and is that what's driving this. And I think not at all, uh, are we remain confident in our core market. Uh, you know, obviously this year, the last couple of quarters we've seen a slow down because of people's sheltering in place as a result of the pandemic, but we thought we've talked about how that's slowly been- been building, uh, since the end of- of Q1 and, you know, next year, certainly as we start to see a number of initiatives kick back up, we feel very good about where we are with the core business. We talked about the population efforts that all of us is gonna be starting in the back half of this year in the US but we'll be wrapping up next year. Similarity, that UK Biobank project has been going on. It paused for a little bit, but it's starting to scale up again. Um, and then, uh, at the NHS effort, which this year has been, uh, sideline to focus on- on COVID is gonna be kicking back up next year. So as we\\u2026 we are optimistic about where population sequencing efforts are gonna be starting into next year. We've seen good news in terms of, uh, guideline changes for NIPT and continued growth in NIPT around the world. Uh, we're seeing continued adoption of our TSO 500 products, and we expect that to continue to drive growth. And then obviously we launched the NextSeq 2000 this year. And so we expect to continue to see that upgrade cycle play out certainly as we get into next year. This move is really about our strategy and our strategy has been guided by our mission to improve human health. By unlocking the part of the genome, our strategy is to provide sequencers and consumables to, uh, to, uh, abroad RAF markets, and then to pick very specific applications where we want to provide the sol- solution ourselves. We wanna pick the largest market opportunities where we can provide a differentiated offering. And frankly, if you look at that criteria, there probably is no other criteria\\u2026 no other space that meets that criteria as well as early cancer detection. It's the largest of the genomic applications that we can imagine over the next 15 years. And GRAIL has built a- a- a very innovation rich portfolio with good IP around it. And so we will have a differentiated offering in that market. And so the price again, the strategy is, you know, horizontally provide sequencers and <inaudible> everywhere and then be very surgical. And that's very common for platform companies. Certainly if you look at\\u2026 you're in technology, whether it's Apple or Amazon or Microsoft, they provide the platform, but then there are specific applications that they provide directly themselves. Typically, the largest application. And having an application actually gives you access to insights that have you created a better platform too. So having specific application also help you\\u2026 helps you have the best platforms in the market. So with that, we'll go to the next question. Certainly. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question to allow others an opportunity. Derik De Bruin with Bank of America, your line is open. Um, hi, good morning. So a couple of questions. Um, I guess the first one, how much Illumina's revenues in 2019 and estimated revenues for 2028 were tied to sales, to GRAIL. Number one. Uh, number two, I\\u2026 a number of questions from investors this morning, just wanting to get some better clarity on the EPS solution is a 20% to 30%, uh, EPS dilution, a reasonable number for the ma-\\u2026 investors to sort of do their models. And number three, what do you expect from the Pathfinder trial readouts, uh, and- and what would be a, what would be a good readout to, uh, enable the LDT launch and just some initial thoughts on the early commercialization efforts and- and what conversations GRAIL has had with potential, um, uh, self-insured employers and sort of the other members that you've talked about. Thank you. Sure. So three questions, I'll take the first one around, uh, GRAIL revenue to Illumina in the last couple of years. Uh, maybe Sam, you can talk about EPS solutions, and then Hans you can, uh, answer the question around the Pathfinder readout. Um, so first one sort of short, uh, in 2019 and 2020 GRAIL was a very, very, very, very small part of our overall revenue. Um, in fact, I typically look at our top 20 customers on a daily and weekly basis. I don't think I ever saw them in either of those two years on those lists. So since a very small part of our revenue for 2019 or ' 2. Um, Sam maybe, uh, EPS? Yeah. So, uh, as I talked about earlier, the- the ramp of off in the first few years is significant driven by the commercialization of Galleri. So our expectations right now is that in the first full year post-close of the deal, that, uh, there would be EPS dilution of somewhere in the, uh, 325 to $375 range. And then, uh, Hans could you talk a little bit about Pathfinder and- and the upcoming readouts and place that in context a little bit? Sure. And- and, uh, folks that aren't familiar Pathfinder is a 6,000 patient clinical trial that's enrolling as we speak. It's a return of results study. So patients in this trial getting the GRAIL test when the test detects the cancer they're getting worked up, um, obviously the results returned to them. So, uh, our expectation is that that real-world trial will- wi- will confirm the performance we've seen in other studies that we've reported to you and covered on the call this morning. The- the other thing that, uh, this study is very important for is it will help us understand the service components of the test that we'll provide, uh, to help make sure that the workup process post a positive test is- is- is simple and good to use for primary care doctors. Thank you. All right. Next question. Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. Great. Thanks guys. Maybe just to follow up on Derik there, just give him the dilution number a- a little bit bigger than we were modeling, uh, so just as the news came out last week. Sam, can you just talk about maybe the OPEX trajectory over the next 12 months, again, to get to that, uh, 350, 375 number you noted? Um, should we expect that number to really take a big jump up from what we saw on the S1 from the, from the, um, the GRAIL OPEX numbers, and then maybe just quickly after that you guys were obviously participating with some upside from GRAIL and royalty as a customer, et cetera. So can you just expand a little more Francis on- on, I guess why you guys wanted to bring it in house and then also give the royalty almost back to them with a 9% over a billion? Um, they're\\u2026 just kind of flush that out a little bit. Thanks guys. Yeah. So I can start on the, uh, on the OPEX trajectory and maybe expanding on this solution to some extent, and I'll remind everybody that we will be providing more, uh, refined financial estimates as we, um, as we get closer to uh, close of the acquisition. So at this point we're giving, you know, directional numbers just to give you a sense of- of what to expect in your models. Um, but, uh, to- to answer your question around the OPEX investments, Patrick, yes. Uh, obviously there will be an increase from what you saw in the S1 and what you saw last year or this year, sorry, I keep saying last year. But what you saw this year in terms of investment by GRAIL, you know, the investment has been, uh, focused on R&D. And as I said, you know, the investment that, uh, was disclosed was 135 million. So if you expect that that's gonna, um, you know, be a full year worth of investment, that's closer to 270, but as you look forward, kind of the Galleri launches, there's gonna be investments around a number of factors. You know, it's gonna be R&D, is gonna be commercial. It's going to be market access, government affairs, uh, you know, uh, DNA to support the business. There are a number of factors that drive that OPEX in the first, um, you know, in the, in the first few years. And until the revenue start to scale, um, that's gonna be significantly diluted. Um, so the number that I mentioned earlier, which is the 325 to 375 in the first full year post launch. So, um, I think, uh, you know, I was also though mention that we're at a $6 billion TAM that's gotten added to our business. You know, the- the revenue opportunity is quite attractive as we, as we look at the long term. Yeah. And then thirdly let me pick up on your question around royalties. So as you pointed out, you know, those\\u2026 the arrangement, we have, you know, have\\u2026 pre- acquisition was <inaudible> that they buy sequencers and consumables from us, but we also get a royalty on- on the GRAIL revenue. And, you know, as we've thought through, you know, we modeled what that looks like over the next 15 years, you know, it's clear to us that, you know, we participate, uh, more fully. So we get more revenue, more margin dollars, uh, in, you know, if we acquired GRAIL. So just financially, this is a much better way of capturing the- the value in the market, uh than continuing to be a supplier to GRAIL with the royalty. And as Sam pointed out there's a $60 billion market opportunity, you know, we- we are able to sort of capture the value better in the current agreement. In terms of, uh, the royalty back to GRAIL shareholders. And just as a point there, as you heard in the prepared remarks, we are 12% currently with the, uh, GRAIL shareholding. So, you know, the royalty by the way adjusted to the 12% that, uh, that we own ourselves. And the thinking here was, look, we were working with the GRAIL investors. Now this is one area where, you know, clearly they see the opportunity in front of them. And there was a gap and I think they saw us and we were a little bit more conservative. And so this was a nice way to sort of bridge doctors, to say, look, we wanna make sure that we participate. If the opportunity is much bigger than we think that everybody wins. Uh, otherwise we all share if it's, if it's a little bit less than we thought. So this was the way to structure it over the next 12 years where we could, you know, align on, you know, benefiting as the market, ends up being much bigger than we, than we thought. Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research, your line is open. Uh, hi, good morning. Uh, thanks for the time I'll ask just to\\u2026 uh, one, I actually want to follow up on a point that- that Tycho raised and it's about, you know, how you wanna articulate, uh, right now, what you think about the- the core business. I appreciate the points that all of us, Biobank, NHS all coming on the next, uh, next year, I'm away to do the pipeline, but I wonder, would you be comfortable, you know, taking a view that the- the core business, the ex- GRAIL business is a double-digit grower, uh, as far as you can see out into the future. And then my second one is, as you think about, uh, the landscape of providers, you know, out five or- or 10 years ago, uh, from now rather five or 10 years from now, what does it look like in terms of how many different cancer detection assays you- you think are out there. Having Illumina involved in- in this particular, uh, way, it means that there's gonna be one, you know, obviously very large scale player, the ways to, uh, to come at this particular market. Can you talk about how you- you see that looking and what is the importance of, uh, the rather substantial IP portfolio, uh, that, uh, you had flagged, uh, Francis and Hans, as you think about what that landscape looks like. Thank you very much. Thank you, Steve. So a couple of questions. One is how do we think about the- the core business? And the second one is how do we think the, uh, landscape for cancer detection assays will play out. Would there be a- a significant single winner or would there be multiple players? So let me go to the first one. You know, the, uh, I absolutely am comfortable, you know, saying that we expect our core business over a multi-year period, you know, to generate double digit growth. You know, we are still, as we said, in the very early stages of understanding from a research perspective, even how genomics translates into, you know, health and disease, but from a clinical perspective, we're also in the very early stages of penetrating some of the markets we talked about. Like oncology therapy selection and genetic disease testing, genetic disease testing we're less than 1% penetration. So I am comfortable that over a multi-year period, you should be seeing double digit growth from the core business. Um, and that, you know, the acquisition of GRAIL is intended to accelerate that even further, but even without it, it's a double digit growth. In terms of how we expect the, uh, cancer detection market to play out. Now, this is a very, very large market. And, you know, we talked about a $60 billion market. And so we expect that there will be multiple approaches, uh, for this market that, you know, some will focus on single cancers or small set of cancers, some will be pan-cancer. Um, and- and finally that's how we've modeled, you know, sort of, uh, the revenues for us that we expect there to be multiple players in are trying multiple different approaches, serving different segments of the market. Um, and- and again, with a market this big and- and this important, we- we expect it to play out that way. And this is all the time we have for questions. The Illumina team, thanks, you all for your participation in today's conference.

Thanks, Colin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis. Maximizing revenue, offsetting the virus\\'s impact for rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement, and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long-term success. To those ends, we grew revenues sequentially each month in the quarter, with September finishing 35% higher than June. We executed on our expense reduction plan, realizing over $25 million of fixed cost savings in the quarter, with the expectation of delivering more than $85 million in 2020.

We strengthen our balance sheet significantly, completing the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, finishing the quarter with over $350 million of cash, a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional debt pay down. While the environment remains uncertain, we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that In the next two weeks, we launched the new Marketplace Minute, a short form, three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, and the economy. Developed in partnership with American Public Media, the Marketplace Minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting. Marketing the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach, the Marketplace Minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcast audiences. On the expense front, we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately $85 million of fixed cost reductions for the year, including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of $36 million. More than 25 million of these fixed cost savings were achieved in Q3, and we anticipate realizing more than 15 million in Q4. Many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic-induced revenue declines. However, others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future, informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs. For example, we consolidated bullseye sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing, research, and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization, as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration that was previously in place. Lastly, we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in nonrevenue-producing functions.\\\\n With the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management, we delivered positive free cash flow for the second straight quarter during the pandemic. We further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions, which brought our quarter end cash balance to more than $350 million. These significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the \\\\\\'a04. \\\\\\'a05. \\\\\\'a06. \\\\\\'a07. \\\\\\'a Plug in the And with that, I\\'ll turn the call over to Frank.\\\\n Frank? Frank Bresciani, CFO, Thank you, Mary.

Thanks, Colin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis. Maximizing revenue, offsetting the virus's impact for rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement, and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long-term success. To those ends, we grew revenues sequentially each month in the quarter, with September finishing 35% higher than June. We executed on our expense reduction plan, realizing over $25 million of fixed cost savings in the quarter, with the expectation of delivering more than $85 million in 2020. We generated positive EBITDA and cash from operations for the quarter, bringing year-to-date free cash flow excluding M&A and the ABL draw ,\"5. To the end of the session, I would like to introduce the next panelist, Dr. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. We strengthen our balance sheet significantly, completing the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, finishing the quarter with over $350 million of cash, a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional debt pay down. While the environment remains uncertain, we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that In the next two weeks, we launched the new Marketplace Minute, a short form, three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, and the economy. Developed in partnership with American Public Media, the Marketplace Minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting. Marketing the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach, the Marketplace Minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcast audiences. On the expense front, we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately $85 million of fixed cost reductions for the year, including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of $36 million. More than 25 million of these fixed cost savings were achieved in Q3, and we anticipate realizing more than 15 million in Q4. Many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic-induced revenue declines. However, others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future, informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs. For example, we consolidated bullseye sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing, research, and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization, as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration that was previously in place. Lastly, we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in nonrevenue-producing functions.\\n With the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management, we delivered positive free cash flow for the second straight quarter during the pandemic. We further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale leaseback transactions, which brought our quarter end cash balance to more than $350 million. These significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the \\'a04. \\'a05. \\'a06. \\'a07. \\'a Plug in the And with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.\\n Frank?

            "Welcome to the Cumulus Media quarterly earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Collin Jones, senior vice president of corporate development and strategy. Sir, you may proceed. Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, to our third-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by our president and CEO, Mary Berner, and our CFO, Frank Lopez-Balboa. Before we start, please note that certain statements in today's press release and discussed on this call may constitute forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current assessments and assumptions, and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will also use certain non- GAAP financial measures. We believe the supplementary information is a, is useful to investors, although it should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A full description of these risks as well as financial reconciliations to non- GAAP terms are in our press release and FCC filing. The press release can be found in the investor relations portion of our website and our form 10-Q, which was also filed with the FCC shortly before this call. A recording of today's call will be available for about a month, and details for how to access that replay can also be found on our website. With that, I'll now turn it over to our president and CEO, Mary Berner. Mary. Thanks, Collin. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis: maximizing revenue, offsetting the virus' impact through rigorous cost management and liquidity enhancement, and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for long-term success. To those ends, we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter, with September finishing 35% higher than June. We executed on our expense-reduction plan, realizing over 25 million affixed-cost savings in the quarter with the expectation of delivering more than 85 million in 2020. We generated positive EBITDA and cash from operations for the quarter, bringing year-to-date free cash flow, excluding M&A and the ABL draw to over 45 million. But we strengthened our balance sheet significantly, completing the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, finishing the quarter with over 350 million of cash, a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and/or additional <inaudible> debt pay down. While the environment remains uncertain, we now have the resources and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet. On virtually all metrics, our third-quarter results represented a significant improvement from Q <inaudible> 2. Same-station revenue finished down 29% year-over-year, but as I mentioned, improved sequentially each month in terms of total dollars. In the spot market, which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business, we saw year-over-year improvement each month, both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars. Like last quarter, our diary markets, which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns, outperformed our PPM markets. Political, as you might expect, was clearly very strong as our footprint overlapped nicely with swing states. We had 5.8 million of political revenue in the quarter, which was a new high-water mark for a third quarter, and have benefited from that spending pace through the election. Government spending also contributed positively in the quarter. And, while still negative versus last year, financial, general services, and professional services also outperformed other categories. Digital, as a whole, posted another quarter of growth. While streaming and local digital marketing services remain pressured in the difficult macroclimate, podcasting more than offset those declines. Up nearly 50% in the quarter, podcasts, or casting, delivered record quarterly revenue, reflecting our particularly strong news-talk portfolio and our highest ever download count, over 102 million in September, up 47% year-over-year. Also in the quarter, we launched the new Marketplace Minute, a short-form three times a day briefing that highlights the most important stories about money, business, economy. Developed in partnership with American Public Media, the Marketplace Minute is distributed across smart speakers, broadcasting, and podcasting. Marking the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach, the Min- Marketplace Minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcasts' audiences. On the expense front, we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately 85 million afis- fixed-cost reductions for the year, including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of 36 million. More than 25 million of these fixed-cost savings were achieved in Q3, and we anticipate realizing more than 15 million in Q4. Many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic-induced revenue declines. However, others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future, informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and/or developed to meet our evolving business needs. For example, we've consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing, research, and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad-channel configuration that was previously in place. Lastly, we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes, particularly in non-revenue producing functions. With the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management, we delivered positive free cash for the second straight quarter during the pandemic. We further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale-leaseback transaction, which brought our quarterly, uh, y- qu- quarter end cash balance to more than 350 million. These significant cash reserves not only provide us security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead, but also the capability and flexibility to act on a creative opportunities that may come our way. Looking ahead, as we move into the fourth quarter, we continue to see positive momentum in bookings, driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams. Current pacing is down in the mid-teens versus last year, with political providing about a 450 basis-point benefit. We remain guarded about the finish to the year, given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country, pol- potential shutdown measures and reaction to that, and the generally uncertain macro environment. So, for the remainder of the fourth quarter and likely well into 2021, while we hope for continued improvement, our performance will remain highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events. However, it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re-engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our cost. That said, given our liquidity position, more ex- efficient expense profile, and growth initiative, we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when it occurs. And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank. Frank. Thank you, Mary. I, I will start by providing some more detail on the third quarter, speaking on a same-station basis and follow that with some additional color on non-operating items. In Q3, total revenue was 196.4 million, down 29.4% from Q3 2019 but an increase of 34.5% over Q2 total revenue. As Mary noted, on a month basis, we saw total revenue improvement as the quarter progressed, with September revenue 35% higher than June. Spot and network markets performed comparably in the quarter, down in the low 30s versus 2019, with digital slightly offsetting those results up 2%, driven by our podcasting business, which was up nearly 50% on an entirely organic basis. Digital dollars represented over 10% of revenue in the quarter. Political spend accelerated as the quarter went on, finishing at 5.8 million versus 1.7 million in Q3 2019 and 3.6 million in Q3 2018. Of note, this was a record quarter for political, and we're on track for another record quarter in Q4. Moving down to P&L, expenses declined by 42 million, or 19%, driven by both reductions and bearable cost related to the revenue declines and active fixed-cost reductions. As Mary mentioned, we continue to expect to rea- realize more than 85 million in benefits in total this year from our fixed-cost actions to date. Of these, more than 25 million were achieved in Q3 and more than 15 million will be achieved in Q4. Broken down between temporary and permanent effects, about 19 million of the 85 million relate to permanent actions, which have an annual <inaudible> expense benefit of approximately 36 million. The amount of the temporary cost that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in 2021. Putting revenues and expense together for the quarter, EBITDA finished at 20.4 million. Normalizing for M&A activity, we once again grew our cash balance by 3.5 million in the quarter, bringing total free cashflow generation year-to-date, excluding M&A and the ABL draw, to more than 45 million. Achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is the result of positive EBITDA generation, rigorous management of working capital, and reduced cap-backs. As we said on our last call, we cut our 2000 and tw- 2020 cap-back spend projection to 17 million, and with 4 million spent in Q3, we are on track to deliver that. Our cash taxes this year have also been materially reduced from the combination of lower operating performance and CARES Act benefits. So, in Q3, we received approximately 2.5 million of tax refunds related to taxes paid in 2019. I would also note that in Q4, working capital requirements coming from increased revenues <inaudible> bond interest payment and, though small, an estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tower sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generated year-to-date. We were pleased to announce, about a month ago, the initial closing of the tower transaction, which provided a cash inflow of 202.3 million. Under our debt agreements, 64 million, the net proceed from the assets being sold and not leased back are required to pay down debt pro rata, subject to a 12-month reinvestment right. 96 million of the proceeds from assets being sold or leased back were required to pay down debt immediately. As such, concurrent with the closing, we paid down 49 million of the term loan at par. And on Monday, October 5th, we launched a tender offer for 47.2 million of senior-secured bonds at par. The tender offer was successfully completed on November 3rd. We do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds from the tower transaction by the end of the first half of 2021. Additionally, for tax purposes, the gain in the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year. That debt now has been reduced by more than 330 million since the beginning of the year and by more than 585 million, or 46%, since the quarter that we emerged from bankruptcy. As a reminder, we do not have financial maintenance convenance in either our term loan or bonds, and they do not mature until 2026. As mentioned on previous calls, we're also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable piece of property in Nashville that we hope to bring to market once commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels. Lastly, I wanted to note some new disclosure in our 10-Q related to NCAA. Based on the cancellation of March Madness in 2020, we believe the rights fees 2020 season are not payable to NCAA. The NCAA, however, chose to terminate the contract based on nonpayment of those fees. On September 28th, 2020, we and the NCAA filed competing lawsuits with regard to the dispute surrounding the agreement. While it is always important for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable, we believe in the merits of our position. At this stage, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the <inaudible> litigation, but we will keep you informed as it progresses. With that, we can now open the line for Q&A. Operator. Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 1. To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from Michael <unk>, Novo Capital Market. Thank you for taking the questions. Um, first of all, I am… I, I was wondering… You had mentioned that you have, obviously, now a large cash position. It was… And you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pare down debt, so I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then, also, if there are M&A opportunities, what you may be looking at. Sure. Hi, Mike. Um, you know, I, I, I think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us, uh, in a fantastic s- position to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists but, as you point out also, opportunistic in ways that we can use, uh, cash to drive value. So, obviously, playing down debt remains a huge priority, and, uh, we know there is a great return to use our cash that way. However, you know, uh, uh, should interesting opportunities come our way, we're open to considering that, uh, whether in radio or otherwise. Uh, but we do recognize the high bar for expected return. And I was just wondering as you were kinda giving us some, um, thoughts about, uh, Q4 and, and the, and the pacings there. Can you just kinda give us a little bit about, uh, color on maybe, uh, spot versus network, um, what you're seeing in digital? Um, just kind of give us a little bit more color on the, um, on the individual line items, uh, in Q4. Um, hi, Michael. It's, uh, Frank. Uh, first, let me, uh, comment about Q3, then I'll give you a little bit more color on Q4. So Q3 had a, a very nice recovery in both the spot and the network markets. And, as you heard in my prepared remarks, they performed comparably. Uh, but I will say that, in the third quarter, uh, the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter as we got into a more, uh, normalized environment. Um, in the fourth quarter, um, both channels are progressing nicely. We're benefiting, uh, in the network, uh, from the return of the NFL, uh, which we're pleased with. Um, the… Uh, the national markets are, are stronger. Uh, if you look at the local markets, though, um, part of the benefits we're getting, uh, in the local markets, clearly political which displaces, to some extent, uh, some of the local business. Uh, so the trends, um, at this point, uh, we're seeing is fairly strong, but it's very <inaudible> and we're cautious, uh, with regard to the, the pandemic and, and the spread and, uh, it remains to be seen how that will impact the rest of the quarter. And how did the bookings look as you go into December, which is outside of the political realm of, you know, what you may have gotten for, in, in, um, in October and November? At this point, we'll really just comment on pacing, um, as of this date. Um, and you'll have more color, obviously, in our earnings call, uh, next year. Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 1. To withdraw your question, press the Pound or the Hash key. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And there are no questions at this time. Okay. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. Thanks. <inaudible>. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n"
